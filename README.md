Greetings! My name is Safinah and currently I am residing in Malaysia 🇲🇾

I am a former HR & Admin professional transitioning into software testing, with a solid foundation built through self-learning and freelance manual testing projects. Skilled in identifying bugs, documenting detailed reproduction steps, and validating user stories. 

Currently, I am seeking a remote QA Tester internship to gain hands-on industry experience and contribute to software quality assurance.
